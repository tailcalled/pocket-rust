pocket-rust
===

A from-scratch, minimal Rust-subset compiler that targets WebAssembly. Small enough that its own subset can express it, so it can eventually self-host inside WASM.

## Project rules

- **No silent deferrals.** Every existing first-class feature must keep working end-to-end with each new one. If an interaction is genuinely out of scope, name it explicitly in the plan *before implementing* and get user approval. "Threading X through is annoying" is not a reason to defer.
- **Maintain the relevant skill in the same change.** Feature-specific knowledge lives in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (see Skills index). When a decision/invariant/layout for one of those areas changes, edit the matching SKILL.md in the same turn. CLAUDE.md stays small: only project-wide rules and the high-level architecture. New features that don't fit any existing skill ship with a new SKILL.md (added to the index).
- **Tests reveal flaws — never restructure tests to avoid gaps.** Fix the gap; expand the test if anything. If a failure is "unrelated" to the feature under test, it's still a real bug — fix it, or at minimum keep the failing assertion in place so the conversation gets forced.
- **Every feature change adds both positive *and* negative tests.** Positive: `expect_answer(...)` against an example. Negative: `compile_source(...)` with a substring assertion on the error. See `testing-conventions` skill for layout and helpers.
- **Known gaps live in `tests/gaps/` as honest failing tests.** When a feature is partially implemented, the case it gets wrong is rejected with a confusing error, or pocket-rust accepts a program rustc rejects (or vice versa), add a test in `tests/gaps/<area>.rs` that asserts the *correct* behavior. Do not `#[ignore]` the test, do not invert it, do not loosen the assertion to make it pass. The test fails honestly; the count of failures in the `gaps` suite is the outstanding-gap budget. When the gap is fixed, the test starts passing — promote it to its proper home (`tests/lang/`, `tests/std/`, etc.) and rewrite if needed. Each gap test carries a comment explaining what rustc does, what pocket-rust does, and what the fix looks like.
- **Stdlib parity TODOs.** When adding to `lib/std/`, walk the matching `std::` API and either implement each method or leave a `// TODO: <method-name> — <missing-feature>` so a `grep -r "TODO" lib/std/` finds everything that becomes implementable when a given feature lands.

## Architecture

- `src/lib.rs` — public surface: `Vfs` and `compile`. Drives the pipeline. **No I/O.**
- `src/span.rs` — `Pos`, `Span`, `Error`, `format_error`. Lexer-tracked line/col.
- `src/lexer.rs` — `tokenize(file, source) -> Vec<Token>`.
- `src/parser.rs` — `parse(file, Vec<Token>) -> Vec<RawItem>`. Recursive-descent.
- `src/ast.rs` — resolved AST. `Module` recursive (carries `source_file`). Each `Expr` and `Pattern` carries a per-fn `id: NodeId`; `Function.node_count` exposes the count.
- `src/typeck/` — type checking. → `typeck-pipeline` skill.
- `src/borrowck/` — CFG-based borrow checker. → `borrowck-pipeline` skill.
- `src/safeck.rs` — enforces unsafe-block requirement for raw-ptr deref + unsafe-fn calls. Reads typeck artifacts; doesn't re-type.
- `src/mono.rs` — `MonoFn` (per-function input to byte emission), `MonoTable` (intern table for `(template_idx, args) → wasm_idx`), and `expand` (eager pre-codegen walker that discovers every reachable monomorphization). → `codegen-machinery` skill.
- `src/layout.rs` — per-mono `compute_layout(&MonoFn) → FrameLayout`. Escape analysis (which bindings have their address taken), Drop-binding addressing, and frame offset assignment. Runs after `mono::expand` and before byte emission. → `codegen-machinery` skill.
- `src/codegen.rs` — `emit(&mut wasm::Module, …)`. Calls `mono::expand` first to populate the table, then iterates the populated entries; for each runs `layout::compute_layout` then emits bytes. Appends to existing module so libraries land first. → `codegen-machinery` skill.
- `src/wasm.rs` — structured WASM repr + byte encoder. → `wasm-encoding` skill.
- `src/main.rs` — I/O shell. Loads `lib/std/` from disk and passes it as a `Library`.
- `lib/std/` — pocket-rust's own (in-language) stdlib. **Not referenced from `src/`.** → `stdlib-layout` skill.
- `tests/` — integration tests. → `testing-conventions` skill.

## Pipeline

`main` populates a `Vfs` per crate and calls `compile(libraries, &user_vfs, user_entry) -> Result<wasm::Module, String>`. `compile` processes each library in order, then the user crate. Per crate: resolve modules (following `mod NAME;` declarations to siblings), run typeck (extending shared `StructTable`/`FuncTable`), borrowck, safeck, and codegen (appending to the shared `wasm::Module`). Codegen internally runs `mono::expand` first to eagerly discover every reachable monomorphization before any byte emission, so per-mono passes (storage layout, drop insertion, eventually inlining) have a complete `MonoTable` to operate on as a batch. The library system is fully generic — `lib.rs` doesn't know about `std`; `main.rs` is the one place that loads `lib/std/`.

The crate root's `name` drives its path prefix: a library's items live at `["std", ...]`; the user crate has `name = ""` so its items live at the empty prefix. The "export iff `current_module.is_empty()`" rule in codegen exports user crate-root functions and never library functions.

Errors flow through `span::Error { file, message, span }`, formatted as `<file>:<line>:<col>: <message>`. Each pass walks the AST independently and reads typeck's per-`Expr.id` artifacts (`expr_types`, `method_resolutions`, `call_resolutions`) — no source-DFS lockstep counters between passes.

## CLI

```
pocket-rust <input-dir> <output.wasm>
```

Walks `<input-dir>` recursively for `*.rs` files, populates a `Vfs`, calls `compile`, writes the bytes.
